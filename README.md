# assertlang

Building and Installation
=========================
`stack install` should be enough to install.

Usage
=====
`assertlang-exe filename`

The `testfiles` directory contains example programs.

Current Limitations
===================
 - Only the assignments for the first failing assertion are shown
 - No operator precedence is implemented, so use of parens is advised
